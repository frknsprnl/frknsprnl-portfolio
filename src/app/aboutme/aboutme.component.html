            <p>Hello! My name is Furkan and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I'm going to have a Bachelor of Science in <span class="highlight">Computer Engineering</span> this year.</p>

            <p>I am flexible and adaptable to any environment and can easily assemble any new technology. I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Web Development, and strive to better myself as a developer, and the development community as a whole. I have also worked in the service sector, I think I have improved my ability to communicate.</p>

            <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
